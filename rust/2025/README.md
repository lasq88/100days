# 100 days of Rust 2025

## Introduction

In 2025 I wanted to try something new. In addition to a traditional 100 days of Yara, I will also be doing 100 days of Rust. For some time it has been my goal to learn Rust, but I've never had enough time for it. I think 100 days challenge is a pretty good format to learn something new, as it doesn't take a lot of time from your day to accomplish one simple task but accumulated gains from many days doing it consistently are big. In a way this is kind of similar to the endurance sports training (which, for those who don't know me is also one of my passions).

## Goal

As "learn Rust" is a pretty vague goal, I decided to focus on a more specific goal of learning Rust for Linux system programming. Therefore, most of the challenges I will undertake in the next 100 days will focus on this specific aspect.

## My background

I am by no means a Software Engineer, I am an Incident Responder, turned Malware Analyst, turned CTI analyst and have a limited experience with programming. I mostly use Python in my everyday tasks, but have some knowledge of C and JavaScript as well. I will probably do some references to Python in these notes, as this is a language I feel most comfortable with.
