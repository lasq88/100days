# Day 10 and 11 - IPC - Local Socket Server and client

Today we will look at another IPC mechanism built-in in Rust: local sockets. Since this was a little bit longer and more complicated than previous days, and also there are 2 different binaries I had to write (server and client), I will cheat and count it as two days. I might do similar multiple-day projects later as we move into the more difficult topic. When I started this, I was hoping to put around 1 hour a day into rust at least, so let's make it like an official rule that 1 day = 1 hour (programming only, i don't count other things like these write-ups that also take time). If I can put 100 hours into Rust in 100 days, I think it is going to be a success.

So Like I said, the idea was to write 2 binaries that can communicated over a local socket. Local socket is a little bit like a named pipe on Windows or UNIX socket on Linux. In fact it's a rust abstraction layer over these 2 underlying mechanism, but because of that it is more portable.

We want to be able to send messages from a client to a server and display the responses.

**Note:** I am also gonna use Gemini more and more for the notes, not only I am trying to save time, but it is insanely good at explaining concepts, often much better than the convoluted documentation. I will though add my notes for particularly difficult / new topics. 


## Code

#### Server

```rust
use interprocess::local_socket::{prelude::*, GenericNamespaced, ListenerOptions, Stream};
use std::io::{self, prelude::*, BufReader};
use std::thread;

fn handle_client(conn: Stream) {
    let mut buffer = String::with_capacity(128);
    let mut conn = BufReader::new(conn);

    loop {
        // Read a line from the client
        match conn.read_line(&mut buffer) {
            Ok(0) => {
                println!("Client disconnected");
                break; // Client closed the connection
            }
            Ok(_) => {
                // Process the received message
                print!("Client sent: {buffer}");

               // Format the response string
                let response = format!("Message {} confirmed!\n", buffer.trim());

                // Send the response back to the client
                conn.get_mut().write_all(response.as_bytes()).unwrap();

                // Clear the buffer for the next message
                buffer.clear();
            }
            Err(e) => {
                eprintln!("Error reading from client: {}", e);
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}

fn main() -> Result<(),()> {
    // Pick a name.
    let printname = "day10.sock";
    let name = printname.to_ns_name::<GenericNamespaced>().unwrap();

    // Configure our listener...
    let opts = ListenerOptions::new().name(name);

    // ...then create it.
    let listener = match opts.create_sync() {
        Err(e) if e.kind() == io::ErrorKind::AddrInUse => {
            eprintln!(
                "Error: could not start server because the socket file is occupied. Please check if
                {printname} is in use by another process and try again."
            );
            panic!("{}", e);
        }
        x => x,
    };

    // The syncronization between the server and client, if any is used, goes here.
    eprintln!("Server running at {printname}");

    for conn in listener.unwrap().incoming().filter_map(|c| c.ok()) {
        println!("Incoming connection!");
        thread::spawn(|| handle_client(conn));
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

#### Client

```rust
use interprocess::TryClone;
use interprocess::local_socket::prelude::LocalSocketStream;
use interprocess::local_socket::traits::Stream;
use interprocess::local_socket::ToNsName;
use interprocess::local_socket::GenericNamespaced;
use std::io::{prelude::*, BufReader, BufWriter};
use std::io;

fn main() {
    // Connect to the server's socket
    let path = "day10.sock".to_ns_name::<GenericNamespaced>().unwrap();
    let conn = <LocalSocketStream as Stream>::connect(path).expect("Couldn't connect to server");

    // Send a message to the server
    loop {
        // Wrap the connection for buffered reading and writing
        let mut writer = BufWriter::new(conn.try_clone().expect("Failed to clone connection"));
        println!("Send a message to the server (write 'exit' to quit):");
        let mut input = String::new();
        io::stdin().read_line(&mut input).expect("Failed to read line");
        if input.trim() == "exit" {
            println!("Exiting");
            break;
        }
        writer.write_all(input.as_bytes()).unwrap();
        writer.flush().unwrap(); // Ensure the message is sent immediately

        // Receive the server's response
        let mut reader  = BufReader::new(writer.into_inner().unwrap());
        let mut buffer = String::new();
        reader.read_line(&mut buffer).unwrap();

        println!("Server replied: {}", buffer);
    }
}
```

## Notes

#### Server

```rust
let mut buffer = String::with_capacity(128);
let mut conn = BufReader::new(conn);
```

This part was new to me. this is how Gemini explained `with_capacity`:

> This line creates a new String in Rust and allocates space for it to hold up to 128 bytes without needing to reallocate memory immediately.

So this is like a preallocated buffer if I understand this correctly.


```rust
loop {
    // ...
}
```

Loops are also important concepts in programming. `loop` is just an indefinite loop (like `while True`) that you can break out from. Rust also have classical `while` and `for` loops, but `loop` is like a syntax abbreviation for `while True`

```rust
match conn.read_line(&mut buffer)
```

This `match` statement handles the result of reading a line from the client using `conn.read_line(&mut buffer)`. The `read_line` function attempts to read a line of text from the `BufReader` and store it in the `buffer`.

* `Ok(0)`: This case indicates that the client has closed the connection. The code prints a message and breaks out of the loop, ending the thread.
* `Ok(_)`: This case indicates that a line was successfully read from the client. The code processes the received message, formats a response, sends the response back to the client, and clears the buffer for the next message.
* `Err(e)`: This case indicates that an error occurred while reading from the client. The code prints an error message and breaks out of the loop.

```rust
let response = format!("Message {} confirmed!\n", buffer.trim());
conn.get_mut().write_all(response.as_bytes()).unwrap();
```

These lines format a response string using `format!` and send it back to the client using `conn.get_mut().write_all(response.as_bytes()).unwrap()`.

```rust
buffer.clear();
```

This line clears the buffer, preparing it for the next message from the client.

```rust
let printname = "day10.sock";
let name = printname.to_ns_name::<GenericNamespaced>().unwrap();
```

These lines define the name of the local socket.

```rust
let opts = ListenerOptions::new().name(name);
```

This line creates a `ListenerOptions` object and sets the socket name.

```rust
let listener = match opts.create_sync() {
```

This `match` statement handles the result of creating a local socket listener using `opts.create_sync()`.

* `Err(e) if e.kind() == io::ErrorKind::AddrInUse`: This case handles the error when the socket file is already in use. It prints an error message and panics.
* `x => x`: This case matches any other result and assigns it to the `listener` variable.

`create_sync()` creates a local socket listener that operates in blocking mode. This means operations on the listener will halt the program's execution until they are complete.


```rust
for conn in listener.unwrap().incoming().filter_map(|c| c.ok()) {
    println!("Incoming connection!");
    thread::spawn(|| handle_client(conn));
}
```
This part was a little bit more complex, so let's handle it to Gemini:

This code snippet is the heart of the server's client handling logic. It sets up a loop that iterates over incoming client connections and spawns a new thread to handle each connection. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **`listener.unwrap()`:**
   - `listener` is the result of creating the local socket listener. It's wrapped in a `Result` type to handle potential errors during creation.
   - `unwrap()` is a method that extracts the value inside the `Result` if it's `Ok` (successful). If the result is an `Err` (error), the program will panic.

2. **`.incoming()`:**
   - This method call, available on the listener object, returns an iterator that yields incoming client connections. Each item produced by this iterator represents a new client trying to connect to the server.

3. **`.filter_map(|c| c.ok())`:**
   - This part is a bit more complex. It uses a combination of `filter_map` and `c.ok()` to handle potential errors during connection establishment.
   - `filter_map` is a method that processes each item in the iterator and applies a closure (a small, anonymous function) to it. In this case, the closure is `|c| c.ok()`. **My note:** `|c| c.ok()` syntax is what they call closure, but you can think of it as an anonyomous function, similar to how lambda functions are in Python for example.
   - `c.ok()` converts the connection result (`c`) into an `Option`. If the connection was successful, it'll be `Some(connection)`. If there was an error, it'll be `None`.
   - `filter_map` then keeps only the `Some` values (successful connections) and discards the `None` values (errors).

4. **`for conn in ...`:**
   - This sets up a loop that iterates over the filtered connections. Each `conn` in the loop represents a successfully established client connection.

5. **`println!("Incoming connection!");`:**
   - This line simply prints a message to the console indicating that a new client has connected.

6. **`thread::spawn(|| handle_client(conn));`:**
   - This is where the magic of concurrency happens.
   - `thread::spawn` creates a new operating system thread.
   - `|| handle_client(conn)` is a closure that defines the code to be executed in the new thread. In this case, it calls the `handle_client` function with the `conn` object, passing the client connection to the function to handle communication.  **My note:** This is also interesting usage of anonymous functions that was new to me. 

**In essence, this code snippet does the following:**

- Listens for incoming client connections.
- Filters out any errors that occur during connection establishment.
- For each successful connection:
  - Prints a message to the console.
  - Spawns a new thread to handle communication with that client.

This allows the server to handle multiple clients concurrently, preventing one client from blocking the server's ability to interact with other clients.

#### Client

```rust
let path = "day10.sock".to_ns_name::<GenericNamespaced>().unwrap();
let conn = <LocalSocketStream as Stream>::connect(path).expect("Couldn't connect to server");
```

These lines establish a connection to the server's local socket.

* `path`: This variable stores the path to the socket file, converted to a namespace-aware path using `to_ns_name`.
* `conn`: This variable stores the connection to the server, established using `connect`.

I also asked Gemini if this is a type cast: `<LocalSocketStream as Stream>::connect(path).expect("Couldn't connect to server");`. Its answer was:

```rust
let conn = <LocalSocketStream as Stream>::connect(path).expect("Couldn't connect to server");
```

It's not exactly a type-cast in the traditional sense, but it's about ensuring the right *trait* is being used.

* **Traits in Rust:** Traits are like interfaces or contracts. They define a set of methods that a type must implement.
* **`LocalSocketStream`:** This is the concrete type representing a local socket connection.
* **`Stream`:** This is a trait that likely defines common methods for stream-based communication, like reading and writing data.

In this line, `<LocalSocketStream as Stream>` means "treat the `LocalSocketStream` type as implementing the `Stream` trait." This is necessary because the `connect` method is likely defined on the `Stream` trait, not directly on the `LocalSocketStream` type.

**Why do this?**

This approach allows for abstraction and flexibility. The `connect` method can be implemented for various types of streams (network sockets, file streams, etc.), as long as they implement the `Stream` trait. This way, the client code doesn't need to know the exact type of stream it's working with, as long as it can use the `connect` method.

**Analogy:**

Imagine you have different types of vehicles: cars, bicycles, motorcycles. They all have a "start" method, but the way you start each one is different.

- `Stream` is like a "Startable" trait that defines the concept of starting.
- `LocalSocketStream` is like a "Car" type.
- `<LocalSocketStream as Stream>` is like saying, "I want to use the 'start' method defined in the 'Startable' trait, but specifically for the 'Car' type."

**Key takeaway:**

`<LocalSocketStream as Stream>` ensures that the `connect` method is called on the `LocalSocketStream` type through the `Stream` trait. This allows for generic code that can work with different types of streams.

```rust
let mut writer = BufWriter::new(conn.try_clone().expect("Failed to clone connection"));
```

This line creates a buffered writer for sending data to the server.

* `conn.try_clone()`: This creates an independent copy of the connection, allowing both reading and writing to occur concurrently.
* `BufWriter`: This wraps the connection in a buffer, improving write efficiency.

```rust
println!("Send a message to the server (write 'exit' to quit):");
let mut input = String::new();
io::stdin().read_line(&mut input).expect("Failed to read line");
```

These lines prompt the user for input and read a line from the standard input.

```rust
if input.trim() == "exit" {
    println!("Exiting");
    break;
}
```

This condition checks if the user entered "exit" and breaks the loop if they did.

```rust
writer.write_all(input.as_bytes()).unwrap();
writer.flush().unwrap();
```

These lines send the user's input to the server.

* `write_all`: This writes the input as bytes to the buffered writer.
* `flush`: This ensures that the data is immediately sent to the server.

```rust
let mut reader = BufReader::new(writer.into_inner().unwrap());
let mut buffer = String::new();
reader.read_line(&mut buffer).unwrap();
```

These lines receive the server's response.

* `writer.into_inner()`: This retrieves the underlying connection from the buffered writer.
* `BufReader`: This wraps the connection in a buffer, improving read efficiency.
* `read_line`: This reads a line from the buffered reader into the `buffer` variable.
